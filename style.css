Theme Name: PressForward-TurnKey-Theme
Theme URI: http://www.github.com/pressforward/pressforward-turnkey-theme
Description: The PressForward-TurnKey-Theme is designed to compliment the PressForward plugin. A homepage with numerous blocks allows users to feature a variety of text heavy content based on category. The homepage blocks can be turned on and off and the content can be manipulated to fit a variety of different publication styles.  The slider pulls in the featured image from a post and the PressForward author (if the PressForward plugin is active).  On individual pages, users can customize the display of the author, comments, and, optionally, display PressForward nomination counts on individual posts. While this theme is designed to compliment the workflow of a PressForward publication it is optimized for use with any site.
