##Theme Requirements
This standalone wordpress theme is based on [Brew](https://github.com/slightlyoffbeat/brew), a Bootstrap and HTML5 Wordpress theme by Dan Wild. 

##Installation
This theme is currently underdevelopment however setup can be completed through the Brew Options Panel in the WordPress dashboard.  The homepage of the theme is broken up into several "blocks". The first block is composed of the slider which draws the most recent 4 posts from a designated category.  The second block is composed of 4 columns that can include a heading, a link to a page, an icon, and some text.  The third block is composed of two rows of three boxes that can be used to display the most recent posts in a particular category or categories.  The title and icon for each box can be filled in via the options panel. 

The final two blocks, the blog post area and the footer, are both controlled by widgets at the moment but will be moved into the options panel soon.  These areas can be used with any widget.

##Support
